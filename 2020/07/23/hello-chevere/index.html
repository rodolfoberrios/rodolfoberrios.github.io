The Chevere application with routing, controller, cache, hooks and a bunch of static code is performing way faster than a bare <code>echo &quot;Hello, World!&quot;</code> and it is doing it with types and data structures everywhere.</p> <p>Application runners are <em>la zorra</em>, but the caveat is that code for it must address thread safety and many other considerations.</p> <p>Not a big deal, I've to change everything anyway and the performance improvement totally worth the effort.</p> <h3 id="🧰-tooling"><a href="#🧰-tooling" class="header-anchor">#</a> 🧰 Tooling</h3> <p>Chevere is a collection of highly opinionated components that provide the basic tooling needed for the changes I require. Rather offering an application model or even over simplify things, it focus exclusively in the tools.</p> <p>In Chevere is common to bring your own stuff and knowledge, as for me each different need suits its own efficient way to develop and present a software system. I don't believe that making fixed application models ease the developers life at all.</p> <p>I just can't live the idea of a fixed application model. What can I say?
